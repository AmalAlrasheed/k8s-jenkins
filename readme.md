# Jenins in K8S
## Configured for K3D using the jenkinsci/blueocean image.

Run the jenkins.sh script, and that should do everything for you. Take a look at this: https://github.com/KnowledgeHut-AWS/jenkins-lab-2-packer/tree/k8s for basic instructions on how to create a kubernetes pipeline. Note: the lab is to get that packer repo actually working -- it's close, but not fully there yet.
