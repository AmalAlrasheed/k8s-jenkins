# Jenins in K8S
## Configured for K3D using the jenkinsci/blueocean image.

Run the `jenkins.sh` script, and that should do everything for you. 
Take a look at this: https://github.com/KnowledgeHut-AWS/jenkins-lab-2-packer/tree/k8s for a basic example on how to create a kubernetes pipeline. 


Note: the lab exercise is to get that packer repo actually working -- it's close, but not fully there yet.
Note2: Also, try to understand the jenkins.sh script, and the associated yaml files -- they're quite interesting.
